                              TERRAFORMER
              Transform the planet. Transform yourself. Transform everything.
================================================================================


WHAT IS TERRAFORMER?
--------------------
Terraformer is an action-adventure game where you are humanity's last hope, a
lone operative dropped onto a barren, hostile world with one mission: bring it
to life. Fight through waves of alien monsters, harness their mysterious energy,
and push the planet's terraforming index to 100%.

But this world doesn't just change around you. It changes YOU.


OBJECTIVE
---------
Reach 100% Terraforming to complete your mission and restore the planet.

Every monster you defeat contributes to the terraforming progress, slowly
turning the hostile wasteland into a living, breathing world. Watch the
environment shift around you as the percentage climbs. The sky changes color,
the ground grows flora, and the air thickens with life.

Don't stop until it's done.


COMBAT & THE TRANSFORM SYSTEM
------------------------------
The core mechanic of Terraformer is TRANSFORMATION. Nothing stays the same.

  MAGICAL ROCKS
  When you kill a monster, it drops a Magical Rock, a crystallized fragment of
  alien energy. Pick it up and it will transform you into a completely different
  character, changing your appearance, stats, abilities, and playstyle on the
  spot. You never know what you'll become next. Adapt, survive, and keep
  pushing forward.

  WEAPON TRANSFORMATION
  Your weapons have a limited ammo supply. When your ammo hits zero, your
  weapon doesn't break. It transforms into a new weapon. Every empty clip is
  a new arsenal waiting to be discovered. Swords become shotguns. Staffs
  become miniguns. Expect the unexpected.

No two runs ever feel the same. Embrace the chaos.


CONTROLS
--------
  W A S D        -  Move
  Left Click     -  Attack
  Right Click    -  Interact

  MAGICAL ROCK MINI-GAME
  When you interact with a Magical Rock, a transformation mini-game begins.
  A bar rotates around a circle. Press the correct key shown on screen at the
  exact moment the bar lands inside the GREEN portion of the circle to
  successfully trigger the transformation. Miss it and you'll have to try
  again. The better your timing, the more powerful the transformation!


ENEMIES
-------
The planet is overrun with monstrous creatures that resist the terraforming
process. They are drawn to your presence and will hunt you down. Defeat them to:

  - Advance the Terraforming %
  - Collect Magical Rocks that transform your character
  - Deplete your ammo and trigger Weapon Transformations

Every enemy is both a threat and an opportunity.


TERRAFORMING PROGRESS
---------------------
Your terraforming meter starts at 0% and must reach 100% to win. Progress is
earned through combat. The more monsters you eliminate, the faster the planet
heals. Keep an eye on the meter and push through even when the odds are against
you.

The planet is counting on you.


TIPS FOR NEW TERRAFORMERS
--------------------------
  - Don't fear running out of ammo. Your next weapon could be even stronger.
  - Always pick up Magical Rocks immediately. A new character form might have
    exactly the abilities you need in that moment.
  - Some character forms have unique interactions. Try Right Click after
    each transformation.
  - Stay aggressive. The faster you clear monsters, the faster the planet
    transforms.


================================================================================
                     Good luck out there, Terraformer.
                          The planet needs you.
