================================================================================

GOAL
----
Defeat enemies to push the Terraforming meter from 0% to 100%. That's it.

CONTROLS
--------
  W A S D        -  Move
  Left Click     -  Attack
  Right Click    -  Interact

MAGICAL ROCK MINI-GAME
----------------------
Kill an enemy → it drops a Magical Rock → Right Click to interact.
A bar rotates around a circle. Hit the correct key when the bar lands in
the GREEN zone. Nail it to transform your character and stats.

WEAPONS
-------
Ammo hits zero → weapon transforms into a new one automatically.
No reloading. No breaking. Just a new weapon every time.

TIPS
----
  - Low ammo = new weapon incoming. Don't panic.
  - Grab Magical Rocks quickly — your new form might suit the fight better.
  - Stay aggressive. More kills = faster terraforming.

                          Good luck, Terraformer.
